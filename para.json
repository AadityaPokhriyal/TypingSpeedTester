["In Engineering Economics, the Law of Demand and Law of Supply are basic economic principles used to analyze market behavior, pricing, and feasibility of engineering projects.Other things remaining constant (ceteris paribus), when the price of a commodity increases, the quantity demanded decreases; and when the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases, This is law of demand.This happens because consumers try to maximize satisfaction and look for cheaper alternatives when prices rise.Other things remaining constant, when the price of a commodity increases, the quantity supplied increases; and when the price decreases, the quantity supplied decreases.This is law of supply.Producers are motivated by profit. Economic analysis helps to compare costs and benefits of projects or investments to decide whether they are worth doing.Interest is the extra amount paid for borrowing money or earned from investing money.Interest is added to the principal after every period, and new interest is calculated on this new total is compound interest. Flow in an economy refers to the continuous movement of goods, services, money, and resources between different sectors of the economy mainly households, firms, government, and foreign sector.It shows how economic activities happen over a period of time.Real flow is the flow of goods and services and factors of production (land, labour, capital, enterprise).Money flow is the flow of money that happens in the opposite direction of the real flow.The flow of money and goods between households and firms forms a circular flow.A firm is an economic unit or organization that produces goods or provides services to earn profit.It uses factors of production land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship to convert inputs into outputs.The Present Worth (PW) or Present Value (PV) method converts all future cash flows (costs or revenues) of a project into their equivalent value at the present time using a chosen interest rate (i).The laws of demand and supply are not mathematical laws, so we cannot use terms like directly proportional for them. Saying directly proportional means an exact mathematical relationship where a fixed change in one variable always causes a fixed change in the other, which is not true in real markets. The law of supply only says that when price increases, supply tends to increase, and when price decreases, supply tends to decrease, assuming other factors remain constant (this condition is called ceteris paribus). Here, price is treated as the cause and supply as the effect, but this relationship is behavioral and general, not exact or numerical. Supply does not increase in a perfectly fixed ratio with price, and the supply curve does not have to start from zero or follow a precise pattern. Also, saying supply increases so price increases is incorrect under the law of supply; that situation belongs to demand-supply interaction, where an increase in supply (with demand constant) usually leads to a fall in price. Therefore, the correct way to express the law is to say that supply varies directly with price or has a positive relationship with price, not that price is directly proportional to supply.","In the early hours of the morning, when the city is neither fully asleep nor completely awake, there exists a strange calm that feels almost artificial. The streets are quiet, but not empty; distant sounds of engines, footsteps, and closing shutters echo faintly through the air. Streetlights cast long shadows that stretch across the pavement like unfinished thoughts, and the air carries a mix of dust, moisture, and yesterday’s heat. This is the time when people who work night shifts head home with tired eyes, while early risers prepare themselves for another routine-filled day. The mind behaves differently during these hours, drifting freely between logic and imagination. Ideas seem clearer, memories feel sharper, and worries appear smaller, as if the darkness itself absorbs some of their weight. It is also the time when productivity either flourishes or completely collapses, depending on the individual. Some people find focus in silence, while others feel an overwhelming urge to sleep. Technology continues to glow relentlessly, with phone screens and laptop displays acting as artificial suns, keeping users awake longer than nature ever intended. Yet, despite all this, there is something deeply human about these quiet hours, something that connects people across cultures and cities. No matter where one lives, the stillness before sunrise feels universally familiar, reminding us that beneath our busy schedules and endless tasks, we all share the same cycle of rest, effort, and renewal.

The beginning stage is usually forgiving, because progress appears fast and mistakes feel harmless. However, as time passes, the learning curve begins to flatten, and improvement slows down noticeably. This is where many people give up, mistakenly believing they lack talent or intelligence, when in reality they are simply encountering the most important phase of growth. Mastery is built not during moments of excitement, but during long periods of repetition, confusion, and self-doubt. This applies equally to academics, programming, music, sports, or even typing. The mind resists boredom and craves novelty, yet true competence demands patience. Small improvements accumulate quietly, often unnoticed, until one day the learner realizes tasks that once felt impossible now feel natural. Consistency matters more than intensity, and showing up daily, even with low energy, produces better results than occasional bursts of motivation. Errors should not be treated as failures, but as feedback, guiding the learner toward better techniques and understanding. Over time, discipline replaces motivation, and effort becomes habit. The process is rarely glamorous, but it is reliable. Those who succeed are not necessarily more gifted; they are simply willing to stay longer in the uncomfortable middle, where progress is slow and rewards are invisible.","Technology has changed the way humans interact with information, communication, and even their own thoughts. In the past, acquiring knowledge required physical effort, such as visiting libraries, attending lectures, or engaging in long discussions. Today, answers are available within seconds, accessible through a small device carried in a pocket. While this convenience has undeniable benefits, it has also introduced new challenges. Attention spans have shortened, deep focus has become rare, and the constant flow of notifications fragments concentration. People often consume information passively, scrolling endlessly without fully processing what they read or watch. Despite this, technology itself is not the enemy; rather, it is how it is used that determines its impact. When applied intentionally, digital tools can enhance learning, creativity, and productivity. Programming, for instance, allows individuals to turn abstract ideas into functional systems, empowering them to solve real-world problems. The internet connects people across continents, enabling collaboration that was once unimaginable. However, balance is crucial. Without boundaries, technology can overwhelm the mind and blur the line between work and rest. Developing the ability to disconnect, reflect, and engage deeply with a single task is becoming a valuable skill in itself. In a world driven by speed and automation, the capacity for thoughtful, focused effort may be one of the most important human advantages remaining.","History is often taught as a sequence of dates, events, and famous names, but its true value lies in the patterns it reveals about human behavior. Across centuries, societies have risen and fallen due to remarkably similar reasons: misuse of power, economic inequality, environmental neglect, and resistance to change. Despite advancements in science and technology, human emotions such as fear, greed, ambition, and hope remain largely unchanged. Empires expand when innovation and cooperation flourish, and they decline when corruption and complacency take root. Studying history is not about memorizing facts; it is about understanding consequences. Decisions made by individuals in positions of authority ripple outward, affecting millions of lives, often in unpredictable ways. At the same time, ordinary people have repeatedly shaped history through collective action, resilience, and creativity. Revolutions, reforms, and social movements rarely begin with grand speeches; they often start with small acts of courage. By examining the past, one gains perspective on the present and humility about the future. History reminds us that progress is neither linear nor guaranteed, and that every generation faces choices that will define its legacy. Ignoring these lessons risks repeating mistakes that could have been avoided.","The concept of time is both simple and deeply complex. Everyone experiences it, yet no one fully understands it. Time appears to move at different speeds depending on context: moments of joy pass quickly, while periods of stress feel endless. A single hour can feel insignificant on a normal day, yet crucial during an exam or emergency. Humans measure time precisely using clocks and calendars, but emotionally, time is far from consistent. Memories compress years into fragments, while anticipation stretches minutes into eternity. Modern life emphasizes efficiency, pushing people to optimize every second, often at the cost of reflection and rest. Schedules become crowded, and the pressure to constantly improve or achieve can make time feel like an enemy rather than a resource. However, time itself is neutral; it is how it is used that determines its value. Spending time learning, creating, or connecting with others can be deeply fulfilling, while wasting time mindlessly often leads to regret. Understanding one’s priorities and aligning actions accordingly can transform the experience of time from stressful to meaningful. Ultimately, time is the one resource equally distributed to all, yet used very differently by each individual.","Problem-solving is a fundamental skill that extends far beyond academic settings. Whether debugging a program, managing finances, or resolving conflicts, the ability to analyze a situation and identify effective solutions is invaluable. Good problem-solving begins with understanding the problem clearly, rather than rushing toward an answer. Many errors occur not because the solution is difficult, but because the problem itself was misunderstood. Breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable parts allows for clearer thinking and reduces mental overload. Trial and error plays an important role, as failed attempts provide information about what does not work. In technical fields like engineering and computer science, logical thinking must be combined with creativity, since not all problems have straightforward solutions. Persistence is often the deciding factor between success and failure. Those who remain calm and methodical under pressure are more likely to reach effective outcomes. Over time, problem-solving ability improves with experience, as patterns become familiar and intuition develops. However, overconfidence can be dangerous, leading to careless mistakes. Maintaining curiosity and a willingness to learn ensures continuous improvement and adaptability in an ever-changing world.","Reading deeply is becoming a rare habit in an age dominated by short-form content. Articles are skimmed, videos are sped up, and long texts are often avoided altogether. While this style of consumption saves time, it sacrifices depth and understanding. Deep reading requires patience and focus, allowing the reader to engage fully with the material and reflect on its meaning. This process strengthens critical thinking, vocabulary, and comprehension skills. Complex ideas cannot always be reduced to summaries without losing nuance. Literature, philosophy, and detailed technical explanations demand attention and mental effort, but they reward the reader with insight and clarity. Reading also exposes individuals to perspectives beyond their own experiences, fostering empathy and intellectual flexibility. Developing the habit of sustained reading may feel challenging at first, especially for those accustomed to constant stimulation. However, like any skill, it improves with practice. Setting aside dedicated time, eliminating distractions, and choosing meaningful material can gradually rebuild attention span. In a fast-paced world, the ability to slow down and think deeply is a powerful advantage.","Education is often misunderstood as merely a pathway to employment, but its true purpose extends far beyond economic outcomes. At its core, education is about learning how to think, question, and adapt. It equips individuals with the tools to navigate uncertainty and make informed decisions. Formal education provides structure and foundational knowledge, but self-education plays an equally important role in personal growth. Curiosity-driven learning encourages exploration beyond prescribed syllabi, allowing individuals to discover interests and strengths they may not have recognized otherwise. In rapidly evolving fields, the ability to learn continuously is more valuable than any single degree. Mistakes and failures are essential components of education, teaching resilience and problem-solving skills that cannot be acquired through success alone. A well-rounded education also includes ethical reasoning, communication skills, and cultural awareness. These qualities help individuals contribute positively to society and engage respectfully with diverse viewpoints. When education is viewed as a lifelong process rather than a finite phase, it becomes a powerful force for both personal fulfillment and collective progress.","The future is often imagined as a distant concept, but in reality, it is shaped by the choices made in the present moment. Small daily habits accumulate over time, producing significant long-term effects. Consistently practicing a skill, maintaining physical health, or managing finances responsibly may not yield immediate rewards, but they create stability and opportunity. Conversely, neglecting these areas can lead to difficulties that feel sudden but were actually years in the making. Planning for the future does not require predicting every outcome; it requires adaptability and awareness. Uncertainty is inevitable, and rigid plans often fail when circumstances change. Developing a mindset that embraces learning and flexibility allows individuals to respond effectively to unexpected challenges. Reflection plays a key role in this process, helping people assess progress and adjust direction when necessary. While the future cannot be controlled, it can be influenced through deliberate effort and thoughtful decision-making. Recognizing this balance between control and acceptance is essential for long-term growth and resilience."]
